# Resource Pack Maker

This modpack includes many mods designed to help you create a resource pack easily. You can simply modify your assets (inside the resource pack directory), save them, and the changes are applied instantly!
It also includes several performance mods to keep the game running smoothly in the background while you're editing your assets.

## ✨ Features
